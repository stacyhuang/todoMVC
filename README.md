## Process

1. Build a Rails TodoMVC application with persistent data

2. Dockerize the application, such that the application can be deployed on any server that runs docker. 

3. Choose a ruby websever and a proxy and set up initial configurations

4. Setup AWS infrastructure - a EC2 instance for the webserver and another for the database

5. Automate the deploy by setting up a jenkins job that can automatically build and deploy the application whenever a new pull request is merged in
